# harness-lens

The native scanner includes `HL032` exact duplicate line/paragraph warnings,
both source locations, and normalization evidence. It also exposes source
budgets and caller-configured input-cost estimates through `EvaluationConfig`.

Reusable Rust SDK for Harness Lens. It combines the generic engine with a safe
filesystem adapter, repository-local configuration resolution, and first-party
deterministic plugins.

Use `discover()` for content-free path discovery or `Scanner::scan()` for a
complete evidence-bearing report. Add analyzers through `Scanner::register_plugin`.
`discover_detailed()` exposes incomplete-scan reasons, and
`Scanner::scan_with_overrides()` safely analyzes unsaved editor buffers.
